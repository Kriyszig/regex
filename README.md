# RegEx

A simple Regular Expression evaluation engine written in Node.js that supports a small subset of the vast Regualar Language  
This implementation is based on a blog post by [Nick Drane](https://nickdrane.com/) that can be found [here](https://nickdrane.com/build-your-own-regex/)

### Support

The program supports regex matching for character literals, and the special symbols `*`, `.`, `?`, `^`, and `$`  
The definition of entire Regular Expression can be found [here](https://github.com/niklongstone/regular-expression-cheat-sheet)
